This is the data/code for my study on emergent watersheds on Mars. Quantitative calculation of terraforming hydrology - how cool is that?

The code is in Mathematica, because I like coding with write-only line noise. I may eventually create a more open version of this code. On the plus side, you can generate basically all the data and figures in the paper with a single click.

Please cite this if you use it academically. Also, I'm new to github, so please forgive this repo's presently ad hoc nature!
